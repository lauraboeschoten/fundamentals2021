# Quick Overview

## Column 1

### Fundamental Techniques in Data Science with `R` 
In nine weeks you will learn the basics of data handling with R and the details about regression techniques in the context of statistical inference, as well as the connection to research philosophy. During every lecture we will treat a different theoretical aspect. Following each lecture there will be a computer lab exercise that connects the statistical theory to practice, as well as a workgroup meeting wherein you will work on solving motivating real-world case studies. 

### Assignment and Grading

The final grade is computed as follows

| Graded part       | Weight      |
|:-------|:------|
| Linear Regression Assignment and presentation | 25 % |
| Logistic Regression Assignment | 25 % |
| Written Exam | 50 % |

To develop the necessary skills for completing the assignments and the presentations, 7 `R` exercises must be made and submitted. These exercises are not graded, but students must fulfil them to pass the course.

In order to pass the course, the final grade must be 5.5 or higher, your contribution to the course should be sufficient and all assignments and `R` exercises should be handed in and/or passed. Otherwise, additional work is required concerning the assignments and/or exercises you have failed.

# Course Manual

## Column 1

### Course description
Regression techniques are widely used to quantify the relationship between two or more variables. In data science it is very common to investigate this relation and linear and logistic regression are proven to be very powerful techniques. However, it is essential to understand how and when it is appropriate to apply these regression techniques. In this course, students will learn exactly how to do that with the statistical software package `R`. 
 
This course gives students a new set of tools to explore the issues and problems so many people care about. The course will help students get acquainted with the principles of analytical data science, linear and logistic regression and introduces the basics of statistical learning. These techniques will be presented in the context of estimation, testing and prediction. Students will learn to adapt these techniques in their way of thinking about statistical inference, which will help students to quantify the uncertainty and measure the accuracy of statistical estimates. Students will develop fundamental `R` programming skills and will gain experience with `tidyverse`, visualize data with `ggplot2` and perform basic data wrangling techniques with `dplyr`. This course makes students better equipped for a further career (e.g. junior researcher or research assistant) or education in research, such as a (research) Master program, or a PhD. 

### Assignment
Students will form groups to choose work on two assigments. Students will need to perform calculations and program code for these assigments. All work needs to be combined in an easy understandable and insightful `R` project and must be submitted to the [Surfdrive file drop environment]((https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/LqUCEt3MWVsW7DF). Each assigment will be graded will be graded on 

1. Quality of the methodological application
2. Model evaluation and assumptions checking
3. Quality of the code and scripts 

### Grading
Students will be evaluated on the following aspects:
 
1. apply and interpret the basic methodological and statistical concepts that are associated with doing predictive and/or inferential research;

a. explain concepts from inferential statistics, such as probability, inference and modeling; and apply them in practice. 
b. make an informed choice for research designs that are suitable for regression analyses.
c. apply and explain the choice for techniques to investigate data problems.
d. apply and explain the concepts of linearity and non-linearity.
e. interpret statistical software output and report software output following APA reporting guidelines.
f. explain and conceptualize statistical inference and its relation to statistical theory.
g. perform the different steps in solving basic regression analysis problems and report on these steps.
 
2. apply and interpret important techniques in linear and logistic regression analysis;

a. perform, interpret and evaluate quantitative (causal) analyses on data with the statistical software platform R.
b. perform analyses in statistical software.
 
### Relation between assessment and objective
- With the exam the knowledge from methodological and statistical concepts is evaluated (learning goals 1a, 1d, 1f), as well as the application of these concepts to research scenarios (learning goals 1b and 1c). During the exam students need to interpret statistical software output (learning goal 1e).
- With the practical lab it is tested if the student has sufficient skills to solve basic analysis problems and execute quantitative analyses on real-life data sets (learning goals 2a and 2b).
- The work groups focuses on applying the newly gained knowledge and skills through a series of motivating real-world case studies aimed at solving relevant data analysis problems and reporting on the steps taken to obtain a solution (learning goal 1g).

After taking this course students can understand innovations in statistical markup, statistical simulation and reproducible research. Students are also able to approach challenges from different professional viewpoints. They have gained experience in marking up a professional manuscript and designing a state-of-the-art statistical archive in an open source repository.

# How to prepare

## Column 1

### Preparing your machine for the course
Dear all, 

This semester you will participate in the **Fundamental Techniques in Data Science with `R`** course at Utrecht University. To realize a steeper learning curve, we will use some functionality that is not part of the base installation for `R`. The below steps guide you through installing both `R` as well as the necessary additions. Please do so before the first meeting. 

I look forward to see you all,  

*Gerko Vink*

### **System requirements**

Bring a laptop computer to the course and make sure that you have full write access and administrator rights to the machine. We will explore programming and compiling in this course. This means that you need full access to your machine. Some corporate laptops come with limited access for their users, I therefore advice you to bring a personal laptop computer to the workgroup meetings. 

### **1. Install `R`**
`R` can be obtained [here](https://cran.r-project.org). We won't use `R` directly in the course, but rather call `R` through `RStudio`. Therefore it needs to be installed. 

### **2. Install `RStudio` Desktop**

Rstudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It can be obtained as stand-alone software [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). The free and open source `RStudio Desktop` version is sufficient.

### **3. Start RStudio and install the following packages. **

Execute the following lines of code in the console window:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "tidyverse", "magrittr", "micemd", "jomo", "pan", 
                 "lme4", "knitr", "rmarkdown", "plotly", "ggplot2", "shiny", 
                 "devtools", "boot", "class", "car", "MASS", "ggplot2movies", 
                 "ISLR", "DAAG", "mice"), 
                 dependencies = TRUE)
```


If you are not sure where to execute code, use the following figure to identify the console:

<center>
  <img src="console.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" width = 70%>
</center>

Just copy and paste the installation command and press the return key. When asked 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
Do you want to install from sources the package which needs 
compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)
```

type `Yes` in the console and press the return key. 

## Column 2

### **What if the steps to the left do not work for me?**
If all fails and you have insufficient rights to your machine, the following web-based service will offer a solution. 

1. Open a free account on [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud). You can run your own cloud-based `RStudio` environment there. 
2. Use Utrecht University's [MyWorkPlace](https://myworkplace.uu.nl/). You would have access to `R` and `RStudio` there. You may need to install packages for new sessions during the course. 

Naturally, you will need internet access for these services to be accessed. 


# Week 1

## Column 1

### Lecture (Monday)
Today's lecture is about the elemental building blocks of `R`. We discuss what the object-oriented programming language `R` is, why we use `RStudio`, how to 'speak' `S`, the scripting language that is used in `R` and how to work with objects and elements. 

You can find the [slides here](Wk1/Lecture-1_FTID.html)

### Workgroup (Thursday)

# Week 4

## Column 1

### Lecture (Monday)
Today's lecture is about statistical inference. Inference is the process of drawing conclusions about true data generating models (TDGM). The most widely know TDGM is the population, the body we aim to infer about in social science and in classical statistics.

Even though statistical inference has been around for a long time, it's associated components, quantities and estimands are not always straightforward. Let's dive a bit deeper into that today, but in order to do so, we need some knowledge about statistical sampling and some widely used distributions. That is why we start today's lecture with random numbers and data generation in `R`.

### Workgroup (Thursday)
**Today's workgroup is online. See the Teams channel.**


## Column 2

### `R` exercise

[The titanic.csv data](data/titanic.csv)

This week's exercise is to:
1. Recreate the plots from slides 28 and 29, but now for females
2. For the model with the interactions:
  
  - Create a confusion matrix for the model with the interactions
  - Perform crossvalidation on the `titanic` model with the interactions

3. See if a model with all variables included is a better fit than the model with the interactions presented in the slides. 
  - The model with all variables (excluding `Name`!) can be simply fit with `glm(Survived ~ . * ., data = titanic[, -3])`
  - The `.` here implies all remaining columns in the data. `. * .` yields the full factorial model between all these columns. 

Hand in a markdown compiled `html` file for Exercise 9 to the [SurfDrive](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/LqUCEt3MWVsW7DF) drop folder. Do this ***before the next lecture on Monday***.

### **What about equations and formulae?**

Your knowledge of matrix algebra will not be tested. So, there is no need to memorize that the regression estimates $\beta$ can be estimated as $\hat{\beta} = ({\bf X}^T{\bf X})^{-1}{\bf X}^Ty$. However, you will need to know, understand and apply equations such as: 

- $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X+\epsilon$ and any more complicated version of this. 
- $\epsilon = y - \hat{y}$
- $\mathbb{E}[y] = \alpha + \beta x.$
- $\log(\text{odds}) = \log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = \log(p) - \log(1-p) = \text{logit}(p)$
- $p_i = \frac{\text{exp}(\eta)}{1+\text{exp}(\eta)} = \frac{\text{exp}(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1,i} + \dots + \beta_nx_{n,i})}{1+\text{exp}(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1,i} + \dots + \beta_nx_{n,i})}$
- etcetera
